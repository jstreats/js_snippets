Subject: Urgent: High API Call Volume from Teambook Impacting Server Performance

Dear Teambook Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to bring to your attention a critical issue we observed yesterday regarding the API call volume originating from Teambook.

Under normal circumstances, we handle a total of approximately 9,000 API requests daily, with 50% of those originating from Teambook. However, yesterday we recorded 24,600 requests from Teambook alone, of which 22,600 were successfully served. This significant spike has placed an unexpected load on our servers, leading to high memory usage, which exceeded 90%, triggering an xMatters alert.

This surge in requests has not only impacted the performance of the DMD API for Teambook but also affected other users, including critical DMD Dashboard users, which is unacceptable for our operations.

To prevent such issues moving forward, we strongly recommend utilizing our development API for testing or high-volume operations. The URL for the dev API is: https://url.

Additionally, with year-end holidays approaching, we will have limited support availability. Therefore, we kindly request you to monitor and manage your API usage carefully during this period to ensure system stability for all users.

We appreciate your cooperation and understanding in addressing this matter. Should you need further assistance or clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out.
