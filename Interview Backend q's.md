**Personal Experience and Background** 
1. Can you share a recent project where you developed APIs? What language did you use? Was it monolithic or microservices architecture? Was it restful or GraphQL?
 
2. Have you had experience working with **secure development lifecycle practices** ? If so, could you explain your approach?
 
3. Was security considered during API development? Have you used tools for security testing? What kind of tests did you perform?

4. Have you used **TypeScript**  in your projects?

**API Development (Node.js and Express.js)** 
1. How do you implement middleware in Express.js for tasks like authentication, validation, or logging?

**PostgreSQL and Database Design**  
1. Describe your experience with PostgreSQL. Have you used advanced features like **JSON/JSONB** , **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** , or **window functions** ?

2. Lets say you were to design a database for a dashboard application for a store with multiple branches. There are apis available at the store level and at the branch level from another system that will get you summarised info for the entire month. 
Example /store/revenue?month=2025-01 returns 500 and /branch/pune/revenue?month=2025- returns 100. How would you design the database to store this data?

3. Lets say you expect the metrics to change a lot and want to make it easy to add new metrics in the future. How would you design the database to store this data? 

4. What strategies do you use to optimize database queries for APIs?

**Scalability and Performance** 
 
1. Have you worked with **caching mechanisms** to improve API performance? If yes, can you share an example? For the previous app, can you design api endpoints? what will you cache and how/when will you invalidate the cache?
