### Observability Tooling Overview 

- Ensure that the document highlights the key capabilities your observability tools provide, matching the minimum criteria described in the image.

- Reference both the service-level and server-level Grafana URLs you mentioned.

### Key Capabilities 
 
1. **Real-Time Application Performance** : Provide insights into real-time monitoring of performance and behaviors using logs, metrics, and traces.
 
2. **Trend Analysis and Bottleneck Prevention** : Outline how near-real-time trends and potential bottlenecks are identified before they impact the system.
 
3. **Integrated Reporting and Dashboards** : Mention how Grafana dashboards are used for effective reporting and interpretation, helping teams make decisions quickly.
 
4. **Upstream/Downstream Dependencies** : Clearly specify how your observability tooling covers upstream/downstream systems and application interdependencies.

### Observability Table (Example) 
| Dependency | Grafana URL | Monitoring Type | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Service Name | Grafana URL for Service | Logs, Metrics, Traces | 
| Upstream Dependency | Grafana URL for Upstream | Logs, Metrics | 
| Downstream Dependency | Grafana URL for Downstream | Metrics, Traces |

**Observability Tooling Documentation** **1. Overview** 
This document provides an overview of the observability tools implemented for monitoring our services and their upstream dependencies. The tooling leverages Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization, ensuring real-time insights and proactive performance management. The observability setup complies with the minimum capability criteria outlined in our service standards.
**Primary Tools Used**  
- **Prometheus** : For collecting and querying metrics.
 
- **Grafana** : For data visualization and dashboard creation.


---

**2. Observability Requirements** 
Our observability solution ensures that the following criteria are met:
 
1. **Real-Time Performance Monitoring** 
  - Observability tooling must be able to observe application performance in real-time against defined capability criteria.
 
2. **Insights into Application Behavior** 
  - Able to provide insights into application behavior and potential performance issues by capturing data points such as logs, metrics, and traces.
 
3. **Proactive Trending and Prevention** 
  - Able to provide near-real-time trending to allow teams to identify and prevent performance bottlenecks before they materialize.
 
4. **Integrated Reporting and Dashboards** 
  - Observability tools should be integrated with appropriate reporting and dashboard tools to improve readability, interpretation, and allow teams to take quick action.
 
5. **End-to-End Visibility** 
  - Observability tools should cover applications and their interdependencies (upstream/downstream systems) to provide end-to-end visibility of application performance and quality issues.

**4. Upstream Dependency Observability** 
To ensure end-to-end visibility, the following upstream dependencies are monitored for health and performance, using Prometheus to collect relevant metrics and Grafana for dashboard visualization.
| Upstream Dependency | Prometheus Metrics Monitored | Grafana Dashboard URL | Type of Monitoring | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Dependency A | CPU, Memory, Response Time, Error Rates | Grafana URL for Dependency A | Logs, Metrics | 
| Dependency B | Request Rates, Throughput, Latency | Grafana URL for Dependency B | Metrics, Traces | 
| Dependency C | Availability, Response Time, Error Rates | Grafana URL for Dependency C | Logs, Metrics | 


---

**5. Reporting and Dashboard Integration** 
Our observability tooling integrates with both Prometheus and Grafana for consistent reporting, making it easier to track and analyze data in a centralized dashboard:
 
- **Grafana Dashboards** : Accessible to relevant stakeholders, offering real-time visualizations of system health and performance.
 
- **Alerts and Notifications** : Prometheus is configured to trigger alerts based on pre-defined thresholds (e.g., high CPU usage, high latency), which are integrated into our incident management system for prompt action.


---

**6. Audit and Compliance** **Audit Trail**  
- **Data Retention** : Metrics collected by Prometheus are retained for [X days] to meet compliance standards.
 
- **Data Export** : Audit logs and performance metrics can be exported in formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) for audit purposes.
 
- **Access Control** : Grafana dashboards are role-based, with restricted access based on user roles to ensure data confidentiality.
**Compliance Standards** 
The observability setup complies with [insert compliance standards here] and ensures data integrity, availability, and confidentiality in alignment with internal and external audit requirements.


---

**7. Conclusion** 
The observability tools implemented provide a robust, scalable, and compliant solution for monitoring service health and performance. Prometheus and Grafana ensure real-time insights, actionable data, and a comprehensive view of the system's interdependencies, helping to prevent bottlenecks and ensure high availability.
